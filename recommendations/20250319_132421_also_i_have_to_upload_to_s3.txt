Query: also i have to upload to s3

Recommendation:
### Recommendation:
1. **Beam Service** (for fetching the file from SFTP)
2. **Batch Service** (for uploading the file to Amazon S3)

These two services combined will allow you to first retrieve the file from the SFTP server and then upload it to S3 efficiently.

---

### Why These Services?
- **Beam Service**: It is designed for SFTP operations like fetching files, ensuring secure and reliable data transfer from external servers.
- **Batch Service**: It specializes in uploading files to Amazon S3 buckets, and it’s optimized for handling uploads even when dealing with large files or frequent operations.

---

### Example Workflow

Here’s how you can fetch a file from an SFTP server using **Beam Service** and then upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket using **Batch Service**.

#### Step-by-Step Code Snippets

1. **Fetch File from SFTP using Beam Service**:

```python
from beam_client import BeamClient

# Initialize Beam client with SFTP credentials
beam_client = BeamClient(
    sftp_host="sftp.example.com",
    sftp_port=22,
    username="your_sftp_username",
    password="your_sftp_password"  # Use a secure method for production
)

remote_file_path = "/remote-directory/your_file.csv"
local_file_path = "/local-directory/your_file.csv"

try:
    # Connect to the SFTP server
    beam_client.connect()

    # Download the file
    beam_client.download_file(remote_file_path, local_file_path)
    print(f"File successfully downloaded to {local_file_path}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while downloading: {e}")

finally:
    # Disconnect from the SFTP server
    beam_client.disconnect()
```

2. **Upload File to S3 using Batch Service**:

```python
from batch_service import BatchClient

# Initialize Batch client with S3 bucket details
batch_client = BatchClient(
    aws_access_key="your_aws_access_key",
    aws_secret_key="your_aws_secret_key",
    region="your_aws_region"
)

bucket_name = "your-s3-bucket"
s3_key = "uploaded-files/your_file.csv"
local_file_path = "/local-directory/your_file.csv"

try:
    # Upload the downloaded file to S3
    batch_client.upload_file_to_s3(bucket_name, s3_key, local_file_path)
    print(f"File successfully uploaded to s3://{bucket_name}/{s3_key}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while uploading to S3: {e}")
```

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Beam Service Setup**:
   - Request credentials and access to the Beam Service.
   - Test SFTP configurations to ensure connectivity.

2. **Batch Service Setup**:
   - Obtain necessary AWS credentials and S3 bucket configuration.
   - Ensure IAM roles and permissions for accessing the S3 bucket are set up.

3. **Integrate Both Services**:
   - Use the first script to fetch the file from the SFTP server.
   - Use the second script to upload the same file to S3.

4. **Secure Credentials**:
   - For both Beam and Batch services, ensure sensitive credentials like SFTP passwords and AWS access keys are securely stored (e.g., environment variables, secrets manager).

5. **Test End-to-End Workflow**:
   - Validate that the file is correctly downloaded and uploaded by comparing checksums or other integrity mechanisms.
