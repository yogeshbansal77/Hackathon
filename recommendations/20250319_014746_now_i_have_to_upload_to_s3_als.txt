Recommendation:
### Recommended Services:
1. **Beam Service**  
   - To fetch a file from the SFTP server (as per your first requirement).  
   
2. **Batch Service**  
   - To upload the downloaded file to an S3 bucket.  

---

### Why These Services?  
- **Beam Service**: Handles fetching files securely from an SFTP server, ensuring reliable file retrieval.  
- **Batch Service**: Specializes in uploading files to Amazon S3, particularly with support for large files and additional operations like compression that you might need later.

### Example Workflow:  
Hereâ€™s how you can achieve the entire task step-by-step:

#### **Step 1: Fetch File from SFTP using Beam Service**
1. Use the Beam Service to fetch the file from the SFTP server (refer to the guide provided earlier).  
2. Retrieve the downloaded file, which will be temporarily stored in your configured location.

#### **Step 2: Upload File to S3 using Batch Service**
1. Use the Batch Service API or UI to:
   - Point to the file fetched by the Beam Service.  
   - Provide your S3 bucket name and the object key (e.g., `uploaded_reports/file_name.csv`) where you want the file stored.  
2. Trigger the upload task, and the file will be uploaded to the S3 bucket.
