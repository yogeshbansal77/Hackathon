Query: explain in detail along with code snippets

Recommendation:
Based on the updated information and the available services, none of the listed services (Batch Service, Document Processor, or API Gateway) specifically handles downloading files from an **SFTP server**. However, Razorpay employees typically use internal utilities or write specific scripts to interact with **external SFTP servers**, often supported by libraries or integrations like Python's `pysftp` or AWS SDKs (if integrated with SFTP-to-S3 workflows).

If no direct Razorpay service exists for this purpose, you can use a combination of Razorpay's **Batch Service** (to handle the downloaded file once retrieved from SFTP) in conjunction with a **custom SFTP download mechanism**. Here's a detailed explanation of how you can implement these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Download File from SFTP Server**
You can use Python's `pysftp` library to fetch a file from an SFTP server programmatically.

#### Code Example:
```python
import pysftp

# Define connection parameters
sftp_host = "sftp.example.com"
sftp_port = 22
username = "razorpay_user"
password = "secure_password"
remote_file_path = "/incoming/data.csv"
local_save_path = "/local/path/to/save/data.csv"

# Connect to the SFTP server and download the file
with pysftp.Connection(host=sftp_host, username=username, password=password, port=sftp_port) as sftp:
    print("Connection successful!")
    sftp.get(remote_file_path, local_save_path)  # Download file
    print(f"File downloaded successfully to {local_save_path}")
```

---

### **Step 2: Upload the File for Processing Using Batch Service**
After downloading the file from the SFTP server, you can upload it to **Batch Service** for further operations like storing it in an S3 bucket or processing it.

#### Example Workflow with Batch Service:
1. Use the Batch Service API to upload the file to S3.
2. Trigger any processing operations on the uploaded file if required.

#### Python Script for Batch Service Interaction:
```python
import requests

# Batch Service API URL (example URL)
batch_service_url = "https://batch-service.internal.razorpay.com/upload"

# Define headers and payload
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your_access_token>"
}
files = {
    "file": open(local_save_path, "rb")
}
payload = {
    "bucket_name": "razorpay-batch-bucket",
    "file_key": "data.csv"  # File name in S3
}

# Upload file to Batch Service
response = requests.post(batch_service_url, headers=headers, files=files, data=payload)

# Check response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("File uploaded successfully to the Batch Service!")
else:
    print(f"Failed to upload file: {response.text}")
```

---

### **Step 3: Use Batch Service for Further Operations**
Once the file is uploaded to Batch Service, you can:
1. Perform **data transformations**.
2. Integrate with **downstream services** for further processing.
3. Store the file permanently in S3 buckets for archival purposes.

---

### Why This Solution Works:
1. The **SFTP approach** ensures external file retrieval.
2. **Batch Service** handles uploading, processing, and any post-processing tasks like storing data in S3, compressing it, or analyzing it.
