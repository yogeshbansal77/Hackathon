Recommendation:
To achieve your goal (fetch a file from SFTP and upload it to S3), here are detailed recommendations and steps:

---

### **Recommended Services**

1. **Beam Service**  
   - Used to fetch files securely from an SFTP server.  
   - It provides SFTP connection, authentication, and scheduling for tasks like downloading files.  

2. **Data Pipeline Service**  
   - Facilitates the second step of uploading the fetched file to S3.  
   - This service allows seamless integration between the file system and AWS S3, along with transformations if needed.  

---

### **Why These Services Are Appropriate?**
- **Beam Service** is tailored for securely connecting to SFTP servers, authenticating, and fetching files. It ensures that your file retrieval is automated and error-free.  
- **Data Pipeline Service** is ideal for uploading files to S3, with support for structured pipelines that can handle file transfers, validations, and even data transformations.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **Step 1: Fetch Files from SFTP Server Using Beam Service**
1. **Configure the SFTP Connection**:
   - Use the Beam Service UI or API to create an SFTP integration in your system:  
     - **Hostname**: e.g., `sftp.example.com`  
     - **Port**: Default is `22`  
     - **Authentication**: Use your credentials (username and password or SSH key).  
     - **Remote File Path**: Specify the file path (e.g., `/data/reports/file.csv`).  
2. **Trigger the File Retrieval**:
   - Either schedule the process or manually initiate it to fetch the file.  
   - The fetched file will be temporarily stored in a configured location (project-specific or local storage).  

#### **Step 2: Upload Files to S3 Using Data Pipeline Service**
1. **Set up AWS S3 as a Target**:  
   - In the Data Pipeline Service, configure your target S3 bucket with the following details:  
     - **Bucket Name**: e.g., `my-s3-bucket`  
     - **Access Details**: AWS IAM credentials for accessing the bucket (Key ID, Secret).  
     - **Key Pattern for Objects**: Define the pattern for the uploaded object, e.g., `uploaded_data/{original_file_name}`.  
2. **Add the File from Beam Output**:  
   - Point the Data Pipeline service to the location where Beam saved the downloaded file.  
   - You can also configure additional transformations (if needed) during the file upload.  
3. **Trigger the Pipeline**:  
   - Manually run the pipeline or schedule it for automatic uploads.

#### **Example for Your Use Case**

**Scenario**: Fetch `monthly_sales_report.csv` from an SFTP server and upload it to an S3 bucket called `analytics-data`.

1. **Beam Service Configuration**:  
   - SFTP Details:  
     ```
     Hostname: sftp.partner.com
     Port: 22
     Username: user123
     Password: yourpassword
     File path: /reports/monthly_sales_report.csv
     ```
   - Output Location: `/tmp/downloads/`

2. **Data Pipeline Setup**:
   - Source File: `/tmp/downloads/monthly_sales_report.csv`  
   - Target S3 Configuration:  
     ```
     Bucket Name: analytics-data
     Object Key: sales_reports/2023-10/monthly_sales_report.csv
     AWS Access Key ID: YOUR_KEY_ID
     AWS Secret Access Key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
     Region: us-east-1
     ```
   - Trigger the upload in the Data Pipeline interface or schedule it.
