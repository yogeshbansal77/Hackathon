Query: i want tio upload file to s3 also

Recommendation:
To accomplish the task of fetching a file from an SFTP server and uploading it to an Amazon S3 bucket, the combination of **Beam Service** and **Batch Service** would be appropriate.

---

### 1. **Recommended Services**:
   - **Beam Service**: To fetch the file from the SFTP server. This service handles SFTP connection, authentication, and file retrieval.
   - **Batch Service**: To upload the fetched file to an S3 bucket. This service is optimized for S3 operations, including uploads.

---

### 2. **Why These Services Are Appropriate**:
   - **Beam Service**:
     - Specifically designed to interact with external SFTP servers for fetching files securely and reliably.
     - Provides scheduling and connection options to automate file retrieval.
   - **Batch Service**:
     - Allows seamless integration with Amazon S3 for file uploads.
     - Supports efficient handling of large files and batch processing if needed.

By using the two services in sequence, you can create an end-to-end workflow for transferring the file from an SFTP server to an S3 bucket.

### 3. **Simple Example Workflow**:

#### Step 1: **Fetch File from SFTP (Beam Service)**
1. Configure your Beam Service job by providing:
   - SFTP host (e.g., `sftp.example.com`)
   - Port (e.g., `22`)
   - Authentication credentials (username and password or SSH key)
   - The file path on the SFTP server (e.g., `/data/my_file.csv`).
2. Trigger the Beam job to fetch the file. The file will then be available locally or in a temporary storage location.

#### Step 2: **Upload File to S3 (Batch Service)**
1. Use Batch Service to specify the target S3 bucket and provide access details:
   - Amazon S3 bucket name (e.g., `my-bucket-name`).
   - AWS credentials (access key and secret key or role-based access).
   - File details (path from Beam Service output, e.g., `/tmp/my_file.csv`).
2. Trigger the Batch Service job to upload the file to the specified bucket.

### 4. **Example Implementation**:
Let’s assume you want to fetch a CSV file from SFTP and upload it to an S3 bucket.

#### Beam Service Configuration:
   ```plaintext
   - SFTP Host: `sftp.partner-server.com`
   - SFTP Port: `22`
   - SFTP Username: `your_username`
   - SFTP Password/Key: `your_password_or_ssh_key`
   - Remote File Path: `/remote-folder/my_file.csv`
   - Output Path: `/tmp/my_file.csv`
   ```

#### Batch Service Configuration:
   ```plaintext
   - S3 Bucket Name: `my-razorpay-bucket`
   - AWS Access Key: `your_aws_access_key`
   - AWS Secret Key: `your_aws_secret_key`
   - Source File Path: `/tmp/my_file.csv`
   ```

Once both jobs are configured and triggered, your file will be:
1. Fetched from the SFTP server using Beam Service.
2. Uploaded to the S3 bucket via Batch Service.
