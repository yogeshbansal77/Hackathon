Recommendation:
### Recommended Service(s):
**Beam Service**

### Why Beam Service?
Beam Service is specifically designed for fetching files from SFTP servers. It supports SFTP connection, authentication, and file downloads, making it an ideal match for your requirement. 

### How to Use Beam Service for Fetching Files from SFTP:
Below is a simple code snippet to help you get started.

```python
from beam_client import BeamClient

# Instantiate the BeamClient
beam = BeamClient(
    host='sftp.example.com',            # SFTP server hostname
    username='your_username',           # SFTP username
    password='your_password'            # SFTP password or private key
)

# Specify the file path to fetch
remote_file_path = "/path/to/sftp/file.txt"
local_file_path = "/path/to/save/local/file.txt"

# Fetch the file
try:
    beam.fetch_file(remote_file_path, local_file_path)
    print(f"File fetched successfully and saved to {local_file_path}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error while fetching file: {str(e)}")
```

### Steps:
1. Replace `sftp.example.com`, `your_username`, and `your_password` with your SFTP server details.
2. Set `remote_file_path` to the file location on the SFTP server.
3. Set `local_file_path` to the desired location where the file will be saved on your system.

Beam Service handles the connection to the server, file authentication, and downloading, allowing you to efficiently retrieve files from an SFTP server. Let me know if you need further assistance!
