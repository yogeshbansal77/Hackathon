Recommendation:
To achieve the task of fetching a file from an SFTP server and uploading it to an Amazon S3 bucket, you can use the following Razorpay internal services:

---

### **1. Recommended Services**

#### **Beam Service**  
- **Purpose**: Fetches files from an SFTP server.  
- **Capabilities**: Establishes SFTP connections, authenticates using credentials or SSH keys, downloads files, and supports scheduling.  

#### **Batch Service**  
- **Purpose**: Uploads files to an Amazon S3 bucket.  
- **Capabilities**: Handles efficient uploads to S3, processes large files, and supports key configurations (e.g., folder paths, regions, etc.).

---

### **2. Why These Services Are Appropriate?**
- **Beam Service** handles your first requirement of securely downloading files from an SFTP server. It has flexible authentication options and offers automation.  
- **Batch Service** is ideal for uploading the fetched file to S3 with minimal configuration. Additionally, it supports operations like batch scripting and large file uploads.

### **3. Detailed Steps with Code Snippets**

Let’s break this task into two parts:

#### **Part 1: Fetch File from SFTP**

Use the **Beam Service** to connect to the SFTP server and fetch the required file.

**Code Snippet** (Python-like pseudocode):
```python
from beam_service import BeamClient

# Step 1: Initialize Beam Client
beam_client = BeamClient(
    hostname="sftp.example.com",   # SFTP server hostname
    port=22,                       # Default SFTP port
    username="user123",            # SFTP username
    password="yourpassword",       # SFTP password (or use SSH key)
)

# Step 2: Fetch the file from SFTP
remote_file_path = "/data/reports/monthly_sales_report.csv"  # SFTP file path
local_file_path = "/tmp/downloads/monthly_sales_report.csv"  # Local save path

try:
    beam_client.download_file(
        remote_path=remote_file_path,
        local_path=local_file_path
    )
    print("File downloaded successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching file from SFTP: {e}")
```

The above snippet demonstrates how to fetch a file (`monthly_sales_report.csv`) from an SFTP server and store it locally in the `/tmp/downloads/` directory.

---

#### **Part 2: Upload File to S3**

Use the **Batch Service** to upload the fetched file to your Amazon S3 bucket.

**Code Snippet**:
```python
from batch_service import BatchClient

# Step 1: Initialize Batch Client
batch_client = BatchClient(
    aws_access_key="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY",           # AWS Access Key
    aws_secret_key="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY",           # AWS Secret Key
    region="us-east-1"                              # S3 Region
)

# Step 2: Upload the file to S3
local_file = "/tmp/downloads/monthly_sales_report.csv"
s3_bucket = "analytics-data"                       # Target S3 bucket
s3_object_key = "sales_reports/2023-10/monthly_sales_report.csv"  # Target path in S3

try:
    batch_client.upload_to_s3(
        local_path=local_file,
        bucket_name=s3_bucket,
        s3_key=s3_object_key
    )
    print("File uploaded successfully to S3.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error uploading file to S3: {e}")
```

This code snippet uploads the file fetched by Beam (`monthly_sales_report.csv`) to an S3 bucket (`analytics-data`) under the folder path `sales_reports/2023-10/`.

---

### **4. Example Workflow**
Let’s put it all together:

1. Use **Beam Service** to fetch the file `monthly_sales_report.csv` from the SFTP server. (Saved locally in `/tmp/downloads/`.)
2. Use **Batch Service** to upload the file to the S3 bucket `analytics-data` in a specific folder structure like `sales_reports/2023-10/monthly_sales_report.csv`.
3. Handle exceptions and logs for troubleshooting.

---

### **Final Workflow: Combined Script**

Here’s the complete workflow as a combined script:

```python
from beam_service import BeamClient
from batch_service import BatchClient

# Step 1: Fetch File from SFTP
beam_client = BeamClient(
    hostname="sftp.example.com",
    port=22,
    username="user123",
    password="yourpassword"
)

remote_file_path = "/data/reports/monthly_sales_report.csv"
local_file_path = "/tmp/downloads/monthly_sales_report.csv"

try:
    print("Fetching file from SFTP...")
    beam_client.download_file(remote_path=remote_file_path, local_path=local_file_path)
    print("File fetched successfully.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error fetching file from SFTP: {e}")
    exit(1)

# Step 2: Upload File to S3
batch_client = BatchClient(
    aws_access_key="YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY",
    aws_secret_key="YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY",
    region="us-east-1"
)

s3_bucket = "analytics-data"
s3_object_key = "sales_reports/2023-10/monthly_sales_report.csv"

try:
    print("Uploading file to S3...")
    batch_client.upload_to_s3(local_path=local_file_path, bucket_name=s3_bucket, s3_key=s3_object_key)
    print("File uploaded successfully to S3.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error uploading file to S3: {e}")
    exit(1)
```
