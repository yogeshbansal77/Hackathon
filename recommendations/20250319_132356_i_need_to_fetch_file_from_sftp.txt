Recommendation:
### Recommendation:
1. **Beam Service**
2. **Why Beam Service?**
   The Beam Service is designed explicitly for tasks that involve fetching files from external SFTP servers. Since your requirement is to fetch files from an SFTP server, Beam Service is the most appropriate option. It handles SFTP authentication and file transfer seamlessly.

### Example Usage of Beam Service

Hereâ€™s how you can use the Beam Service to fetch a file from an SFTP server. Below is an example code snippet you can refer to (adapt this to your specific configurations):

```python
from beam_client import BeamClient

# Initialize Beam client with credentials/configuration
beam_client = BeamClient(
    sftp_host="sftp.example.com",
    sftp_port=22,  # Default port is 22
    username="your_sftp_username",
    password="your_sftp_password"  # Use a more secure method for passwords in production
)

# Specify the file you want to fetch and the local path to save it
remote_file_path = "/remote-directory/your_file.csv"
local_file_path = "/local-directory/your_file.csv"

try:
    # Connect to the SFTP server
    beam_client.connect()

    # Fetch the specific file
    beam_client.download_file(remote_file_path, local_file_path)

    print(f"File successfully downloaded to {local_file_path}")

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")

finally:
    # Disconnect from the SFTP server
    beam_client.disconnect()
```

### Steps for Implementation:
1. **Set up Beam Service access:** Reach out to the relevant internal team to set up the Beam Service configuration with the SFTP server credentials.
2. **Use provided SDKs or APIs:** Utilize the official Beam SDK, API, or any internal tools to interact with the Beam Service.
3. **Secure credentials:** Ensure SFTP credentials are handled securely (e.g., encrypted storage or environment variables).
4. **Test the fetch operation:** Test the above script or configuration changes in a development environment before using it in production.
