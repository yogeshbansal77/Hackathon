Query: i have to fetch file from sftp, which service i can use

Recommendation:
Based on your requirement to fetch files from an SFTP server, I recommend using **Beam Service**.

### Recommendation:
1. **Service**: Beam Service
2. **Reason**: Beam Service is specifically designed to fetch files from SFTP servers, which includes connecting to external SFTP locations, authenticating, and downloading files in the required format. This aligns perfectly with your task.

### Example Use Case of Beam Service:

Let's assume you need to download a file named `data.csv` from the SFTP server `sftp.example.com`, using the username `razorpay_user` and password `secure_password`.

#### Steps to use Beam Service:
1. Pass the SFTP connection parameters (e.g., hostname, port, username, password).
2. Specify the file path and location of the file on the SFTP server.
3. Use Beam Service's APIs or scripts to trigger the download.

#### Sample Workflow:
- **Input to Beam Service**:
  - SFTP server: `sftp.example.com`
  - Port: `22`
  - Username: `razorpay_user`
  - Password: `secure_password`
  - Remote file path: `/incoming/data.csv`

- **Output**:
  - File `data.csv` downloaded to your desired local directory.

#### Example API Integration:
```json
{
  "sftp_host": "sftp.example.com",
  "sftp_port": 22,
  "username": "razorpay_user",
  "password": "secure_password",
  "remote_file_path": "/incoming/data.csv",
  "local_save_path": "/local/path/to/save/data.csv"
}
```

The above payload can be passed to the Beam Service API to fetch and save the file.
