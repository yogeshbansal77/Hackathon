Recommendation:
### Recommended Service:
**Beam Service**

### Why Beam Service?
The Beam Service is specifically designed to fetch files from SFTP servers. It supports connecting to external SFTP locations, authenticating with the server, and downloading files, which exactly matches your requirement. It also provides scheduling and automation capabilities if you need to repeatedly fetch files.

### How to Use Beam Service for Fetching Files from SFTP:
Hereâ€™s a simple step-by-step guide to achieve this:

1. **Configure SFTP Server Details:**
   - Provide the server hostname (e.g., `sftp.example.com`), username, password, or an SSH key for authentication.
   - Optionally, specify the directory or file path on the SFTP server you wish to access.

2. **Set Up Connection:**
   - Use the Beam API or internal UI to create a connection to the SFTP server by entering the authentication and server details.

3. **Specify the File to Fetch:**
   - Mention the file(s) or use a pattern (e.g., `*.csv` to fetch all CSV files).

4. **Trigger the Fetching:**
   - Either manually trigger the file-fetch task or schedule it to happen periodically (e.g., daily or hourly).

5. **Access the Fetched File:**
   - The fetched file will either be stored in a predefined storage location or returned based on your configuration.

#### Example Use Case:

   - Hostname: `sftp.partner.com`
   - Username: `user123`
   - Password: `securepassword`
   - File path: `/reports/monthly_sales_report.csv`

2. Trigger the fetch operation using the Beam Service interface or API.

3. Downloaded files will be available in your configured storage or immediately accessible.
