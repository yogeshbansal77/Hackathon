### **Steps to Get GitHub Access**

#### **Step 1: Create or Use Your GitHub Account**
   - If you donâ€™t have a GitHub account, sign up at [https://github.com](https://github.com).  
   - Razorpay requires individuals to log in to GitHub using **Single Sign-On (SSO)**, so ensure your GitHub account email matches your organizational account.

#### **Step 2: Generate SSH Key**
   - Open your local terminal and run:
     ```
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@razorpay.com"
     ```
   - Save the key to the default location and copy the contents of the public key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`).

#### **Step 3: Raise a Jira Ticket (INFRA Request)**
   - Go to Razorpayâ€™s Jira portal at [https://razorpay.atlassian.net](https://razorpay.atlassian.net).  
   - Create a **new INFRA ticket** with the following details:  
     - **Ticket Type:** GitHub Access  
     - **Subject:** Request for GitHub Access  
     - **Attachments:** Approval from DBOPS (if needed).  
     - **Description:** Mention your GitHub username and details of the repositories you need access to.  

#### Example Description for Jira Ticket:
   ```
   Hi Team,  
   I am a new joiner in the <Your Team/Department>.  
   My GitHub username: <Your GitHub Username>.
   Please grant access to the following repositories: <List of repos>.  
   SSH key has been generated and attached for your reference.  
   Thanks!  
   ```

#### **Step 4: Add the SSH Key to GitHub**
   - Log into GitHub.  
   - Navigate to **Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key** and paste the key you copied earlier.  

#### **Step 5: Approval and Access Grant**
   - Once the DevOps team processes the Jira ticket, youâ€™ll receive a confirmation.  
   - Test your access by cloning a repository:  
     ```
     git clone git@github.com:razorpay/<repository_name>.git
     ```
