Currently, making changes to the live Spinnaker system is risky as it can cause downtime and disrupt deployments. A Canary Spinnaker allows testing changes without affecting the live system, increasing availability, enabling faster improvements, and reducing fear of outages. It also supports enhancements like version upgrades and deploying Spinnaker components via Helm charts.",
