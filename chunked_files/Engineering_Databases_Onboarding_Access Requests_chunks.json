Initially, after logging in, users may not have access to view or create Jira issues. To obtain access, users need to request it by contacting the IT team through the #tech_it Slack channel and mentioning @officeit. Once the IT team confirms the access, users need to log out and log back in after 30 minutes to gain access to Jira and be able to view and create new issues.",
