        "description": "This section explains the process of migrating from using AWS IAM Access Keys to using IAM Roles for the Atlantis tool, which is used for managing Terraform workflows. The goal is to ensure that existing Terraform workflows that use Access Keys continue to work while also enabling the use of IAM Roles for new or updated workflows. The section provides details on setting up an IAM Role with a trust policy that allows the Atlantis pod to assume the role, and configuring the AWS credentials file and provider settings to support both Access Keys and IAM Roles.",
