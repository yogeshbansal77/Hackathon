It provides step-by-step instructions on how to identify the SFTP account credentials, download the file from a source (email, Slack, etc.), transfer it to a jump box server, and then finally upload it to the BEAM server using either a password or an SSH key authentication method. The process involves multiple steps of copying files between different servers before reaching the final destination.",

It provides step-by-step instructions on how to upload a file to a specific SFTP path defined in a BEAM job configuration. The process involves downloading the file, uploading it to an S3 bucket, and then calling the BEAM push API with the job name, bucket details, and file path. The response from the API indicates whether the file transfer was successful or not. The section also mentions an alternative method for testing on a stage environment and how to request access to the test bucket if needed.",
