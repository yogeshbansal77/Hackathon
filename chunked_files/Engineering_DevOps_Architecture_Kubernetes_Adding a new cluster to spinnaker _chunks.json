        "description": "This section explains the process of adding a new Kubernetes cluster to the Spinnaker deployment management platform. It involves making changes to the Vishnu and Halyard pods, which are responsible for managing the Spinnaker configuration and deployment. The steps include creating a service account, cluster role, and cluster role binding for the new cluster, generating tokens, storing them in Credstash, and updating the Vishnu and Halyard configuration files. Additionally, it covers executing commands from the Halyard pod to apply the changes to Spinnaker, verifying the cluster access, and deploying a test application from the Spinnaker console.",
