These metrics can be low-level system metrics like CPU or memory usage, or higher-level application-specific metrics like requests per second or server pool membership. Some metrics are represented as a percentage of total capacity, while others are rates that indicate how busy a component is.",

Metrics are raw data points that provide insights into the behavior and health of a system, while monitoring is the process of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing these metrics to gain a holistic view of the system's performance, identify issues, and trigger automated responses. Metrics are the building blocks, and monitoring is the process of making sense of these metrics to understand trends, correlations, and changes in the system.",

It discusses how monitoring systems provide visualizations to help identify trends and understand the interactions between different components. Additionally, it highlights the ability of monitoring systems to correlate data from multiple sources, enabling administrators to recognize patterns and relationships between events across different resources. The section also introduces the monitoring tools used at Razorpay, including Amazon CloudWatch, Prometheus, StatusCake, and Sumologic, and briefly describes their functionalities.",
