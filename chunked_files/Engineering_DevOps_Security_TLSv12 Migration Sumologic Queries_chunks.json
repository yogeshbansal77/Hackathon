        "description": "This section provides a Sumologic query to identify merchants who are still using the older TLS 1.1 protocol for secure communication. The query filters the API trace logs for a specific merchant ID, extracts relevant fields like the TLS version, merchant ID, route, and URL, and then counts the number of requests using TLS 1.1. This information can help identify merchants who need to migrate to the more secure TLS 1.2 protocol.",
