A private key is a crucial component in the process of obtaining a public CA (Certificate Authority) signed certificate, which is commonly used for secure communication over the internet. The section provides a command snippet that can be used to generate a private key file, which is a necessary first step before creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) and obtaining a CA-signed certificate.",
