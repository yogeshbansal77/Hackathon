        "description": "This section outlines the steps to migrate the Goproxy application to a new Auto Scaling Group (ASG) with a new node selector. Goproxy is used to bypass API rate limits imposed by registry apps. The process involves creating a new ASG, deploying a new Goproxy instance with a new node selector, sharing the new node selector with developers, verifying that the old ASG is no longer being used, and finally decommissioning the old ASG and deployments in phases.",
