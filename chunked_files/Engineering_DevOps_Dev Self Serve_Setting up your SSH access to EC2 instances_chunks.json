It involves raising a JIRA ticket, generating an SSH key pair, getting approval from the manager and DevOps team, setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) using Duo, and accessing the bastion hosts (hagrid.razorpay.com and prod.ds.jump.razorpay.vpc) using SSH key forwarding. The process aims to ensure secure access to the company's infrastructure.",
