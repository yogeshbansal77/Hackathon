It involves setting up a GitHub webhook that triggers an AWS Lambda function when changes occur in specific repositories. The Lambda function verifies the webhook's authenticity using a shared GitHub token and then creates a ticket in Freshdesk using the Freshdesk API key. The section also recommends using AWS Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store for securely storing sensitive configuration data like API keys and tokens instead of environment variables.",
