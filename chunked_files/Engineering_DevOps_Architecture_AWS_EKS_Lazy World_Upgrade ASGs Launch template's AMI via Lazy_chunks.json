        "description": "This section introduces a process to automate the upgrade of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) used by Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) through a tool called Lazy. It explains that previously, this process was manual and time-consuming, involving creating a dummy pull request, planning, and creating a new version of the launch template. With Lazy, this process is now automated, making it more efficient and streamlined.",
