        "description": "This section explains the problem that existed before the introduction of the Incident Notifier Bot at Razorpay. The IM Team had to constantly monitor critical Slack channels for any cross-postings or incidents reported by developers or bots, apart from those reported by Pager Duty. This manual monitoring process was difficult and time-consuming, as it required someone to be available 24/7 to initiate an incident and engage stakeholders to resolve the issue.",

These bots can also initiate a Zoom bridge to facilitate immediate collaboration among stakeholders. This solution has been implemented for multiple critical channels, such as #potential-outages and #financial-outages, to ensure prompt response and resolution of potential incidents.",
