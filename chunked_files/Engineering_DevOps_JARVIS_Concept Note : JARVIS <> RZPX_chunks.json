Jarviskube deployment is a prerequisite for running Kubectl commands on a given cluster. The section suggests two approaches that could be taken for this automation, but does not provide details about these approaches.",

        "description": "This section outlines two potential approaches for integrating the RZPX Jarviskube with the existing Jarvis system in the ops-common-cluster. The first approach involves integrating the RZPX Jarviskube directly with the existing Jarvis system, while the second approach involves deploying a new Jarvis deployment in the RZPX cluster with a separate endpoint. The section mentions that approval from the Compliance team is required to determine which approach should be taken, and it concludes by stating that approval has been obtained to proceed with the first approach.",
