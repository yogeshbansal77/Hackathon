It involves obtaining approval from stakeholders, fetching tokenized card numbers, decrypting them, encrypting the data using PGP encryption, and securely transferring the encrypted file via SFTP. The process emphasizes strict adherence to security protocols and the deletion of sensitive data after the transfer.",
