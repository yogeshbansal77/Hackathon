        "description": "This section explains a CRON job called 'DMS CRON' that runs every 60 minutes. Its purpose is to fetch a list of directories from an S3 storage location and trigger a webhook in Spinnaker to check if each directory is 'drift-free' (meaning no changes have been made). If a directory is drift-free, DMS (likely a Data Management System) can then change the status of that directory from 'blocked' to 'free'. If this CRON job is not running, DMS will not be able to update the status of drift-free directories, potentially causing issues with data access or management.",
