It lists three specific problems: inability to locate credentials, unauthorized errors when trying to access AWS resources, and permission issues despite having the necessary KIAM annotations set on the pod or namespace. These issues can arise due to misconfiguration, incorrect permissions, or other factors related to the integration between Kubernetes and AWS IAM.",
