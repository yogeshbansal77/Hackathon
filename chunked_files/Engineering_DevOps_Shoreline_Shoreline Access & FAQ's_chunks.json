There are two Google groups, 'Shoreline-Stage' and 'Shoreline-Prod', that grant access to the staging and production environments of the Shoreline app, respectively. To gain access, users need to request the IT team (@techit) in the #tech_it channel to add them to the appropriate group. Once added, users can access the Shoreline app through Google Apps, and the app will redirect them to the corresponding staging or production URL. Direct access to the endpoints is not recommended.",
