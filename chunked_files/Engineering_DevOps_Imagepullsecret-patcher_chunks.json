        "description": "This section explains that the 'imagepullsecret-patcher' is an automated tool that creates a registry secret in a newly created namespace. This secret is required to pull container images from a private registry. If a new namespace experiences an 'imagepullbackoff' error, it could be because the registry secret was not created, or the 'imagepullsecret-patcher' pod is not running. The tool is designed to run on x86 nodes and is not a multi-arch image, so it may not work on ARM nodes.",

This simplifies the management of access to private registries across the entire Kubernetes cluster.",
