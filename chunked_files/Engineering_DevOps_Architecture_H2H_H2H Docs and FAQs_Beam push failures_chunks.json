        "description": "This section provides a query to search for error logs related to file push failures in a Docker environment. The query filters logs from the 'Docker-logs' source and 'prod-beam' collector, extracts the 'level' field from the JSON-formatted logs, and then filters for logs with an 'error' level and a 'push' job type. This can help identify and troubleshoot issues when pushing files or images to a Docker registry.",
