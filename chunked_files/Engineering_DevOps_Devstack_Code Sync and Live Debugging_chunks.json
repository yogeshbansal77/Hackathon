It explains that you need to make certain application-side changes in your app's repository to enable the use of the 'devspace' feature. Additionally, you must have services deployed on the 'devstack' environment with a unique label. The section also mentions that if you have run the onboarding script from the 'Devstack Onboarding' repository, the required 'devspace' binary would already be installed.",
