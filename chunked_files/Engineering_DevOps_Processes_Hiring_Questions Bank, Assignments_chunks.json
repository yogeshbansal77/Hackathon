The screening round assesses the candidate's knowledge and skills in various areas such as DevOps leadership, Linux and networking, architectural exposure, AWS cloud, Kubernetes, Docker, and handling zombie processes. The machine/coding round tests the candidate's problem-solving approach by presenting them with multi-level questions related to either Linux or Kubernetes, based on their area of expertise. The Linux/networking round evaluates the candidate's understanding of the underlying systems of Linux and networking, which is crucial for troubleshooting incidents and designing systems.",
