When the pod count reaches zero, the Atlantis service becomes inaccessible, meaning that infrastructure changes cannot be managed or monitored. This issue occurs within the 'atlantis' namespace of the cluster.",

If the disk space is full, it recommends increasing the disk space as it is an EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume. Additionally, it suggests trying to rotate the pod as a potential resolution. The section also includes a link to the Vajra dashboard, which likely provides monitoring and visualization capabilities for the Atlantis CPU and memory usage.",
