        "description": "This section explains the process of migrating from KIAM (Kubernetes IAM Authenticator) to using AWS Service Accounts for accessing AWS resources from within a Kubernetes cluster. It highlights the advantages of using Service Accounts, such as eliminating the need for user authentication, avoiding rate-limiting issues, and reducing latency. The section also provides step-by-step instructions for creating Service Accounts for Kubernetes cluster namespaces, including prerequisites and different scenarios based on whether the required IAM role already exists or needs to be created.",
